            <h3>&#x1F528; Version 1.1.0 - 10/29/2025 &#x1F528;</h3>
            <p class="seperator">
                I've made several important changes to improve the overall reliability and functionality of the extension. The Summarize feature has been temporarily removed as we continue to refine its performance and ensure more accurate,
                consistent results. I am actively working on enhancing this capability, and it will be reintroduced in a future update once it meets the quality standards we aim to deliver. In addition, I'm excited to introduce a new Collect URL
                feature designed to make your note-taking experience even more organized and context-aware. When enabled via the checkbox option, this feature automatically saves the website’s URL alongside your note, allowing you to easily 
                trace information back to its original source. This improvement enhances productivity for users who manage multiple notes across various sites and helps maintain clear reference tracking within your saved content.
                <br /><br />
                I appreciate your patience and continued support as I work to make the extension smarter, faster, and more useful with every update.

            <p class="seperator">
                ClipNote was launched today! This Google Chrome extension allows the user to seamlessly take notes online through the use of our quick and easy Ctrl + Enter shortcut, or through the classic copy-and-paste method!
                ClipNote also has a summarize function where the user can enter in paragraphs of information and ClipNote will summarize the information for you in clear, easy-to-read, information dense sentences!
                We hope you enjoy!
