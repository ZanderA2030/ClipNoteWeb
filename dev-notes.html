            <h3>&#127881; Push of v1.1.0 of ClipNote - 10/29/2025</h3>
            <div class="seperator">
                <p>
                    Version 1.1.0 of ClipNote was pushed out today and should be accesible for downloads and updates within the next 3-5 business days. This new version of ClipNote includes a Collect URL function where you can collect a webpages
                    URL when saving a note either through the Ctrl (Cmd) + Enter shortcut or by the copy-and-paste method. The summarize feature of this new version of ClipNote has also been removed for the time being as it was not working reliably.
                    I am going to continue to work on this to bring you all the best version of ClipNote with the most capabilities possible!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some news on the accesibility of ClipNote though: ClipNote currently only works within Chrome, Edge, and Safari. For whatever reason, it does not work in browsers such as OperaGX. It's compatibilities have not been tested with
                    FireFox though, so the accesibility of the extension there is currently unknown.

            <div class="seperator">
                <p>It has come to my attention that there are a few bugs that have been identified with the initial launch of ClipNote. These bugs include:</p>
                <p>The Ctrl + Enter shortcut not working for OperaGX;</p>
                <p>The extension crashing after one use and not opening in OperaGX;</p>
                <p>The summarize function not working correctly.</p>
                <p>&#x1F6A7; I am starting work on these issues ASAP and will have them resolved as soon as I can. &#x1F6A7;</p>
